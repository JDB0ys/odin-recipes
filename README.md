Welcome to my Odin Project!

I am teaching myself how to code so I can be a better business partner for technical founders when I start getting into startups. 

This specific project will focus on making a website for recipes. This will be the "second" website I will have made, after the inital one I made in a COMP 101 class that hosted a non-profit site for Rottweiler awareness. 

One I have completed this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:
- Creating a repository on GitHub and uploading it to my local machine through the command line
- How to create a basic website, that includes headings, text, images, and absolute and relative links
- How to write code in HTML
