        <h3>Breaded chicken tenderloins that are straight from the restaurant</h3>
        <p>If you're craving some delicious chicken strips, look no further! Simple and easy to make, these lightly breaded chicken strips are fantastic on their own with some plum sauce or add them to a sandwhich or wrap to really bring the flavour.<p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>8 chicken tenderloins</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk egg in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix bread crumbs and oil together in a second bowl until mixture becomes loose and crumbly.</li>
            <li>Dip each chicken tenderloin into the bowl of egg; shake off any residual egg. Dip chicken into crumb mixture, making sure it is evenly and fully covered.</li>
            <li>Lay chicken tenderloins in the air fryer basket in an even layer.</li>
            <li>Air-fry until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
